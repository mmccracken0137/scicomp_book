    "## Getting started with the ItsyBitsy 2040 and CircuitPython\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will work with `circuitpython` an implementation of `python` that runs on microcontrollers.  A microcontroller can be thought of as a small computer that reads/applies voltages to from/to electronic devices based on how it is programmed.  `circuitpython` allows us to use `python` to tell our microcontroller how to behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our work will happen in Mu.  This notebook serves as a rough set of notes and in-class problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuring your ItsyBitsy\n",
    "\n",
    "First we have to set up our ItsyBitsy to run `circuitpython`.\n",
    "If you get stuck, Adafruit provides a LOTS of great info [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-itsybitsy-rp2040?gclid=Cj0KCQjwpImTBhCmARIsAKr58cyh8RAWJTX6vksQ2wjPP402KB8WYACLtVM5YsjFqXamdDtzxqffuUsaAuQjEALw_wcB)\n",

    "1. Download the ItsyBitsy-specific CircuitPython implementation from [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_itsybitsy_rp2040/).  We're going to use the current version (7.2.5), but any 7.x will work for this tutorial.\n",
    "2. Install the uf2 file on your ItsyBitsy (IB).  Plug the IB into USB.  From Adafruit: \n",
    "> To enter the bootloader, hold down the BOOT/BOOTSEL button (highlighted in red above), and while continuing to hold it (don't let go!), press and release the reset button (highlighted in blue above). Continue to hold the BOOT/BOOTSEL button until the RPI-RP2 drive appears!\n",
    "3. Move the uf2 file to RPI-RP2 drive that appears on your computer.  The drive will disappear and reappear with the name \"CIRCUITPY\".  You're (almost) ready to rock!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming for the ItsyBitsy\n",
    "\n",
    "CircuitPython IS Python... with a lot of other microcontroller-specific capabilities built in.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run code on the IB, we write the code as a stand-alone python program on our computer and then save it as `code.py` on the IB.  This is doable with any editor, but we'll be using `Mu` because it is optimized for `circuitpython`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please download `Mu` [here](https://codewith.mu/en/download).\n",

    "`circuitpython` has some nifty built-in modules.  Here are two examples we'll use below:\n",
    "- `time` -- especially `sleep`\n",
    "- `board` -- Gives access to board features/components.  Try `dir(board)`.\n",
    "- `digitalio` \n",
    "\n",
    "Other modules are specific to the board we are using.  For example, the IB has a built-in NeoPixel, and Adafruit provides libraries for easy NeoPixel control.  Lots more libraries available from [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) -- please download the `zip` bundle (make sure it matches the 7.x `circuitpython` version)."
