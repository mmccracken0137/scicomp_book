    "## What is pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda)\n",
    "\n",
    "> The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo) also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name \"giant panda\" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.\n",
    "\n",
    "These pandas do not manage tabular data; rather, they eat bamboo.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, thanks!  Homework is due in one week.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ahem... What is `pandas`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` is a very popular `python` library that is built to manage tabular data.  By \"tabular data\" we mean something like a spreadsheet -- information that is arranged into separate instances (typically rows) and features (typically columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have already worked with tabular data in this class.  We read data from a file (usually CSV formatted) using some basic file I/O procedures (`readline()`, `string.split()`, etc.).  When we introduced this, you may have thought to yourself \"There has **got** to be a better, more-efficient way of doing this!\"  If you thought this, you were correct!  `pandas` is the better, more-efficient way of working with tabular data in `python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to cover the basics of `pandas` fucntionality, but it's important to state that `pandas` is *soooooo powerful* that it is a professional-grade tool, ubiquitous in the quantitative world!  Researchers in the physical sciences, social sciences, finance, medicine, and public health use `pandas` to work with large, complex, real-world data.  As a result, there is a great wealth of `pandas` information and help online!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are (at least) two ways to introduce `pandas`: from the basic `pandas` structures up to the tabular dataset level, or from the tabular dataset level down to the basic structures.  We'll take the first approach, but you might consider going through this notebook backwards to see how the concepts connect in the opposite way."

    "`pandas` organizes data based on two structures: `Series` and `DataFrame`. `DataFrames` are composed of `Series`(es). \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of `Series` [(documentation here, take a look at all of those attributes/methods!)](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html) will seem familiar to you -- it's basically an ordered list with a lot of other slick features built into it!  Let's take iport the module and initialize a `Series` to see what it can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with some data stored as a basic `python` list and then convert convert it to a `Series`.  Ooh, let's do some role-playing, too: We are the managers of a restaurant, and we want to build a dataset that contains information about our menu."

For example, let's say we have a list of values that we need to update -- perhaps it's the list of balances in several back accounts.  We might wish to create a copy of the list that can serve as a record of the original values that were stored in the list.  You might guess that we can just initiatlize a new variable in the following way:"
