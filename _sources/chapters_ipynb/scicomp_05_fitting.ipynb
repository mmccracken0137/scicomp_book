    "## Fitting/model optimization as an idea\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lesson 4 we discussed how data visualization can help help us to turn data into understanding.  \"Understanding\" in this sense means something like a *qualitative understanding* of the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll look at a method for turning data into quantitative results: fitting functions to data, sometimes called \"model optimization\".  This is an indispensible skill/technique in the physical sciences, and it's something that you've probably done many times using Excel or Logger Pro.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the basic idea: Often in the physical sciences, we have data that we believe should be described by some quantitative model.  For example, the data might be vertical position *vs* time measurements for a projectile, and we might assume that this data is described by one of the kinematic equations: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y(t) = \\frac{1}{2}a_{y}\\;t^2 + v_{0y}\\;t + y_0\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is our *model* and it is typically the consequence of some underlying physical law (in this case, N2L).  The goal of *fitting the model to the data* is to determine the values of the physical parameters in the model that make the model *best characterize the data*.  For the kinematic model above, this means determining the optimal values of $a_y$, $v_{0y}$, and $y_0$.  We call these the \"fit parameters\" because they are the quantities that we will vary in order to fit the model to the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we fit the model to the data, we should get optimal values for the fit parameters and their associated uncertainties.  These are the derived measurements of physical quanties -- the results of our analysis!  If we continue with the projectile example, these results might include a measurement of the local acceleration due to gravity (and associated uncertainty).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've done fitting in Excel or LoggerPro, you know that there's a toolkit for doing this that proves a handfull of functions/models that the software is decent at fitting -- these are functions like polynomials, exponentials, *etc.*  These tools built into Excel are pretty weak, though.  What if we need a function that Excel doesn't offer?  What the heck does $R^2$ mean?  What if my data has non-uniform uncertainties?  How do I know the uncertainty on the fit parameter values?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python (and other languages) have modules or libraries that do fitting, as well.  These modules are *much* more powerful and general than what you'll find in Excel, but this power comes at the cost of having to learn some new syntax and concepts. \n",

    "The approach outlined above allows the user to fit *any* function to any dataset, and has many other built-in flexibilities.  It's POWERFUL.  This may not seem like a big deal, but as you work with more-sophisticated data, Excel and Logger Pro's built-in functions just won't cut it.  LoggerPro has no option for a sum of two gaussians.  Don't even ask about Excel.  In addition, you can do things like place bounds on the parameters (\"don't let the mean get bigger than 1.2\") and you can fit multiple subranges of the dataset.  These modules are designed by data scientists -- if you have a specific need, chances are good that a python developer thought of it a long time ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Modularity and scalability \n",
    "\n",
    "If you write the code once, you can apply it to *many* datasets very quickly.  Let's say that I now gave you thirty more datasets to fit as above.  You could simply put all of this code inside of a loop over the data file names and let this one program structure automate the fitting for all of the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Data uncertainties \n",
    "\n",
    "More sophisticated techniques like this allow you to handle uncertainties on your data points.  These experimental uncertainties affect fits!  If a single data point has a very small uncertainty, then the fit should \"feel\" obligated to match the fuction to that point as closely as the other points.  We'll demonstrate this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Parameter uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "The fitting techniques above provide quantites like the fit-parameter uncertainties.  This leads to a better scientific understanding of whatever you're studying.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you fit a function with, *e.g.*, Excel, the software tells you what the \"optimal\" values of the fit parameters are, but it does not give the uncertainties on these parameters.  What does this mean?  Well, when we fit data with a function, we're trying to determine the values of the fit parameters that make the function as close to the data points as possible.  In many cases \"as close as possible\" is ambiguous; if we change the value of the first parameter, the function may get farther from one data point but closer to another.  Thus, there's an inherent uncertainty in the value of the fit parameter returned by the fitting algorithm.  This is just like how we use an experimental uncertaintly to mean (roughly) \"we're confident of the value of this quantity to within $\\pm \\sigma$\".\n",
