    "## Introduction\n",
    "In PHY 220 we'll be investigating some of the foundational principles of computer programming, specifically those which are useful in the physical sciences.  Now, you may ask yourself, \"Why?\"  I have a pretty good, two-fold answer for this...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The study of science (as a student) and pursuit of scientific research are often characterized by doing long, difficult, or tedious calculations.  While much insight can be acheived by doing such things by hand (and we'll definitely make you do them by hand at some point), modern computation has allowed physicists, mathematicians, biologists, chemists, social scientists, and researchers in many other fields to do things that they previously thought impossibly or prohibitively time-consuming.  [There are entire fields of physics, chemistry, and biology that are possible *only* with the use of computers. (See Lattice Gauge Theory, Computational Biophysics, Genomics/Bioinformatics, etc.).]\n",
    "1. Physics experiments are often expensive... REALLY expensive.  [*E.g.*, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN cost more than 13 gigadollars to construct and has an annual operating budget of about 1 gigadollars!]  Physics experiments often take a long time to build and perform.  [*E.g.*, planning for the next generation of high-energy accelerators began over twenty years ago and the experiments wouldn't be built (if at all) for another 20 years.]  Before investing massive amounts of capital and effort (and energy!), scientists rely on simulations of their experiments to suggest whether they are feasible and will give the desired precision or scope.  This is hard, but it's a heck of a lot cheaper (and more responsible) than dropping gigadollars on a project that *might not* work.\n",
    "1. Science is (loosely) concerned with drawing conclusions about the Universe by considering measurements of the Universe.  We now live in an era of **BIG DATA**, volumes of information too vast for humans to process in any useful amount of time.  The only way to turn these data into knowledge and wisdom is with computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, programming is a vital part of almost all fields of scholarly scientific research and industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a motivational example: John A. Swanson, W&J's cool-guy benefactor, made his fortune by developing a computational suite (ANSYS) that allows designers to, among many other things, simulate and test structural properties of materials and components before they are physically prototyped.  ANSYS was a gamechanger in the world of engineering and industrial design.  Maybe you'll make something similar!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is essential to modern research and industry, we have built several stages of computing education into the Physics Major.  In this course, you'll study the basics using Python, a general-purpose language.  Hopefully you'll gain an appreciation of what computers can do and how they're used by the pros.  "

    "\n",
    "Python, or more commonly `python`, is a general-purpose, object-oriented, interpreted programming language that has several benefits relevant to this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) It is F R E E.  You can/should install it on your personal computer.  If you are interested in doing so, get the Anaconda distribution that is maintained by Continuum.  Check out the downloads here: www.anaconda.com/download\n",
    "\n",
    "b) python is (relatively) simple to learn.  Most of the syntax is human-readable and intuitive (once you learn a little bit about it).\n",
    "\n",
    "c) It's ubiquitous!  python is platform-independent (will work on almost any OS).  Even though it's simple, many people use python to do meaningful programming.  Python is also nearly ubiquitous for applications in economics, robotics, artificial intelligence, finance, computational biology, *etc.*, *etc.*, *etc*.  As such, it is VERY well documented...\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Documentation/support network.  Many smart people use python, and the on-line community is excellent.  The answer to most of your python questions is just a Google/Yahoo/AltaVista/AskJeeves away.  (Similar to LaTeX!)\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the difficulties that students sometimes have with learning programming what I call the \"WHAT THE H%&! IS GOING ON PROBLEM\" (TM).  If you're new to programming and to using a computer in a meaningful way, it's difficult to form a conceptual model of what is happening where.  Here is all you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is computer programming?\n",
    "Computer programming is the name given to the process of writing *programs* (\"code\") that tell a computer what to do.  Programs are written in a *language* (python is a language) and interpreted by the computer to manipulate the computer's hardware.  Learning how to program is a two-tiered process: you need to learn what types of things a computer can be told to do, and you need to learn the language (\"syntax\" in a given programming language) that allows you instruct the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Insert human language-learning analogy.]\n",

This is called a \"Jupyter notebook.\"  This isn't the way that most \"real programmers\" write code, but this will serve as a nice sandbox in which we can play and in which I can interleave comments and instructions.  There are (at least) two types of \"cells\" here.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Markdown cells (like this one) are just text that is intended to be read.  [OMG YOU'RE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW.]\n",
    "1. Code cells are python code that gets executed.  Code cells are usually followed by output cells.\n",

    "\n",
    "Again, this might look a bit Mickey-Mouse-y, but it works well for getting up to speed.  I assure that in a few weeks you'll be doing some rad stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "An IMPORTANT thing to know is that even though you are writing and running these programs in your browser, they are manipulating the hardware of your computer.  The browser only acts as a canvas here; no networking is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an example of a \"high-level\" language, meaning that the instructions and syntax that you will type are easy to read and interpret by humans.  The python knows how to interpret these commands into instructions for the computer's hardware.  There are other languages that are \"closer to the metal\", but python will be better for learning the basics of what a program is and does.\n",
