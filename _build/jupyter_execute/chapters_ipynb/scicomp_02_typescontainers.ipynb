    "Let's just take a moment to remind ourselves how far we've come.  Here are some of the many things that we know how to do already:\n",
    "- basic mathematical operations\n",
    "- function definition\n",
    "- iteration and recursion with loop control structures `for` and `while`\n",
    "- keeping track of variables outside of loops (i.e., counting and summing)\n",

    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I mentioned at the beginning of the class that one of the uses of computation in the physical sciences was for simulating experiments or apparatus that are prohibitively complicated.  It's important to note that studying a simulation is **not** the same as studying the \"real world\" -- the behavior of the simulation will depend on our current understanding of the laws that govern the real world, and these may not be correct!  Still, simulations are very useful for hypothesis testing.  To that end, check this out:\n",
    "- Cue evolution simulation code.  What hypotheses can we test? (Note: If you're not actually enrolled in the course, you won't get to see this!  The demo is similar-ish to David Randall Miller's work [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk).  Very cool!"

Ugh!  Gross.  That would take so much time!  With computers, I can generate millions of blackjack hands according to the deck properties and history with a bit of sly programming.  This hinges on a) the computer's ability to do loops and b) the computer's ability to generate random numbers.\n",
