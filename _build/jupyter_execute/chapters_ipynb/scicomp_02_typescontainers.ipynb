    "Let's just take a moment to remind ourselves how far we've come.  Here are some of the many things that we know how to do already:\n",
    "- basic mathematical operations\n",
    "- function definition\n",
    "- iteration and recursion with loop control structures `for` and `while`\n",
    "- keeping track of variables outside of loops (i.e., counting and summing)\n",

    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I mentioned at the beginning of the class that one of the uses of computation in the physical sciences was for simulating experiments or apparatus that are prohibitively complicated.  It's important to note that studying a simulation is **not** the same as studying the \"real world\" -- the behavior of the simulation will depend on our current understanding of the laws that govern the real world, and these may not be correct!  Still, simulations are very useful for hypothesis testing.  To that end, check this out:\n",
    "- Cue evolution simulation code.  What hypotheses can we test? (Note: If you're not actually enrolled in the course, you won't get to see this!  The demo is similar-ish to David Randall Miller's work [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk).  Very cool!"

Ugh!  Gross.  That would take so much time!  With computers, I can generate millions of blackjack hands according to the deck properties and history with a bit of sly programming.  This hinges on a) the computer's ability to do loops and b) the computer's ability to generate random numbers.\n",

Use Google to find a way to track how long your program takes to run.  A bonus point will be awarded to the fastest sort algorithm in the class.\n",

    "8. A bag of M\\&M's contains a total of 100 pieces, $n$ of which are red and $(100-n)$ of which are brown.  Let's say that you randomly draw 8 M\\&M's from the bag, yielding 2 red and 6 brown.  You want to use this sampling to predict the total number of browns in the bag. Obviously this one sample doesn't tell you exactly what's in the bag, but it can help you to update your *expectations* of what's in the bag.  For example, you now know that there's a 0\\% probability that the bag contains only 3 brown M\\&M's!  So, here's what you're going to do:\n",
    "- Choose a value for $n$ between 6 and 98.  Perform a simulation of 1000 draws of 8 M\\&M's from the bag.  Calculate the percentage of these draws that yields 4 browns and 4 reds.  Call this percentage $p(n)$.\n",
    "- Now calculate $p(n)$ for **each** value of $n$ between 6 and 98.\n",
    "- The owner of the M\\&M's opens the bag and counts the actual $n$ without showing you the results.  The owner offers to pay you \\$100 if you can correctly guess the *actual* $n$.  You get 10 guesses.  Which values do you guess?\n",
