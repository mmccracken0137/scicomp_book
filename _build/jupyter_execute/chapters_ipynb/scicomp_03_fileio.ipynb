    "- basic mathematical operations\n",
    "- function definition\n",
    "- iteration and recursion with loop control structures `for` and `while`\n",
    "- keeping track of variables outside of loops (i.e., counting and summing)\n",
    "- function definition and using function *inside* of loops\n",
    "- conditionals with `if`, `else`, and `elif`\n",
    "- types: `int`, `float`, `string`\n",

    "### A quick comment on IDEs\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've been working in Jupyter notebooks, which are a great format for inermingling markdown (text) and code.  This isn't the way that most software development happens, though.\n",
    "More often, we write software as stand-alone programs (*i.e.*, code only) that can be run on any platform.\n",
    "To do so in this class, we'll use the interactive development environment (IDE) Spyder\\* that I'll demonstrate now.\n",
    "Daily class work will still happen in notebooks, but you should consider doing and handing your homework in as separate programs (with `.py` file extension). \n",
    "\n",
    "\\*You can also use PyCharm.\\*\\*\n",

    "## File I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern research fields involve collecting data and then \"analyzing\" this data to produce results.  A straight-forward example would be something like the US Census; data (information from each household) is collected, and then an analysis is performed to produce aggregate results like income distributions, demographics, *etc.*  Very rarely in physics are collected data and results the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have analyzed data earlier in your life with a spreadsheet program like Excel, and this is fine for some tasks.\n",
    "When datasets get LARGE or one is interested in more sophisticated or multi-dimensional analyses, Excel (or similar) is inefficient, confusing, incapable, and in some cases dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now seen that computers are better than humans at completing repetitive, tedious tasks.\n",
    "Computers are also arguiably better than humans at relibly storing and retrieving data.  Once we've generated a large dataset, we want to store it in a file, and (hopefully) retreive that data for later analysis.  These activities are usually referred to as \"File Input/Output\" or \"File I/O\".\n",

In the code snippet above, we set the value of the variable statement to be something that definitely wasn't a number (\"Hello world!\").  In fact, when `python` writes anything (even a number) to file, if first converts it to a string.  When `python` reads anything (even something that is obviously (to you or me) is a number) from file, it does so as a string.  So, when performing file I/O we sometimes need to be careful to convert to/from strings.\n",

    "1. The file `NBA_game_data_2000-2014.csv` contains NBA game data (teams, dates, scores) from 15 seans of regular and post-season play. That's nearly 20k games!  Let's say that your instructor believes that the outcomes of some NBA games are determined by non-competitive factors (*i.e.*, some of the games are rigged).  Calculate the following quantities to begin investigating:\n",
    "    - total number of games\n",
    "    - fraction of total games that are won by ~less~ fewer than 3 points\n",
    "    - fraction of total games that are won by the home team\n",

    "4. To prevent cheating, a casino monitors the outcomes of dice rolls at one of its craps tables.  Outcomes for 10000 rolls are given in the file `dice_data.txt`.  Read in this file and determine the following:\n",
    "    - How many times did the thrower roll snake eyes (1 and 1)?\n",
    "    - How many times did the thrower roll box cars (6 and 6)?\n",
    "    - How many times did the thrower roll dice totaling 7?\n",
    "    - You now own this casino.  After reviewing the data, do you suspect that something fishy is going on?  Explain with quantitative evidence.  For example, if the dice are fair, how often *should* each of the outcomes in parts a-c happen?\n",

    "5. Return to the dice data from problem 4.  Which die do you suspect of being unfair?  Support your claim with quantitative evidence.\n",

    "#### Mega-meanies\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Return to the dice data from problem 4.  Do you have reason to believe that one of the croupiers is responsible for cheating?  Support your claim with quantitative evidence.\n",
    "7. Return to the NBA game data from problem 3. Calculate:\n",
    "    - number of games in which the home team won\n",
    "    - fraction of games that went to overtime\n",
    "    - fraction of home-team wins in which the home team was losing at the beginning of the 4th quarter\n",
    "    - fraction of games that the LA Lakers (most likely cheaters in the league) come from behind in the 4th quarter and won\n"
