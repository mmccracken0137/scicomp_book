    "1. Basic mathematical operations: `+, - , *, /`\n",
    "1. Variable declaration and storing numerical values in variables.  This is done with the `=` operator.\n",
    "1. Basic run-time errors.  If your code doesn't run, `python` sometimes offers helpful error reports.\n",

    "- [GAN for face generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSLJriaOumA)\n",
    "- [SegNet, a DC-autoencoder for image segmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxanE_W46ts)\n",
    "- [Mandelbrot Set \"hard zoom\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm_Q1FO9bP4). The Mandelbrot set is generated by iterating the operation $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$ beginning with $z = 0$.  The *complex* number $c$ is in the Mandelbrot set if this iteration eventually settles to zero.\n",

    "## Control structures: Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "*Control structures* are programming structures (functions or ways of combining functions) that... um... control the way that our code will run.  Broadly, control structures allow us to make the computer do repetitive tasks (*loops*) and allow us to make the computer's behavior depend on parameters in our calculation or other inputs (*conditionals*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with **loops**.  We use a loop when we need to perform some task over and over and over and over again.  In the previous lesson we talked about *why* it is a good thing that we have computers to do this mindless work for us.  The vast majority of the calculations we do in the physical sciences are doable with pencil and paper -- however, the manual approach would take so long that these calculations would be *effectively* impossible.  The automation of such calcultions with computers has advanced science a great deal since the 1940s!  For an example, check out the [history of the cracking of the German Enigma machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2_Q9FoD-oQ&ab_channel=Numberphile).\n",
    "\n",
    "Where loops are concerned, we distinguish between two types of implementations/calculations:\n",
    "- **Iteration** -- the simplest type of loop calculations, performing a repetitive task over and over, say $N$ times.  In an iteration problem, we could in principle begin our calculations anywhere in the series of calculations.  In Lesson 0 we saw an interation problem where we added up all of the numbers between 0 and 2022.\n",
    "- **Recursion** -- this is more challenging type of loop where the $n+1$th calculation depends on the results of the $n$th calculation.  For a recursion problem, we can't simply start wherever; we need to do the calculation in order and keep track of the values at each step in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic types of loop control structures: definite and indefinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definite Loops, `for`\n",
    "\n",
    "A definite loop is one that must happen a fixed number of times, AND we *know* this number of times before we begin running our program.  In `python`, this is most easily/compactly achieved with the `for` loop.  A `for` loop performs the tasks inside of the loop FOR (get it?) a fixed number of times.  The syntax for writing a `for` loop in python looks like this:"

    "- Note that the stuff that the computer does in the loop doesn't change; rather, it's the value of the variable `i` that is changing!\n",
    "- `range()` is a compact way of setting the parameters of a `for` loop.  `range(N)` generates a list of numbers between 0 and `N-1`.  Note that this default behavior considers the \"first ten integers\" to be the numbers 0 through 9.\n",

Said another way, each time we go through the loop, we produce some values that are used the *next* time the loop is executed.  This process is called **recursion**, and the loop and it's calculation are said to be **recursive**.  The interest calculation that we did above (with a loop) is a recursive calculation because the balance in year $n$ depends on the balance in the year $n-1$.\n",

    "Your homework is to complete 4 of the following problems.  You do *not* have to do all of the problems below.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Write a program that counts the number of perfect squares (cubes?) between 1 and 1000000.  Note that there are *at least* two ways to do this.  Is this iteration of recursion?\n",
    "1. Write a program that computes the first 900 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.  Recall/behold that the $n^\\textrm{th}$ Fibonacci number, $f_n$, is given by\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "f_n = f_{n-2} + f_{n-1} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "with the specification that $f_0 = 0$ and $f_1 = 1$. Said another way, we get each number in the Fibonacci sequence by adding the two that precede it.  Your program should also calculate the ratio $f_i / f_{i-1}$. For each number in the sequence.\n",
    "1. Write a program that computes the integral \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{8\\pi} \\cos^{4}(x^3)\\; dx.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "How small does your `dx` have to be to get within 0.01\\% of the analytical solution, $\\frac{3\\pi}{4}$?\n",
    "1. A lake has 2500 ducks on it in year 0.  In each \"normal\" year, the duck population increases by 6.2\\%.  However, if the population goes over 3201, the lake gets too crowded and 1428 duck move to another lake.  If the number of ducks is below 2500, there is abundant food and the number of ducks increases by 8.9\\% annually.  Find the number of ducks on the lake in the year 3000.  Your program should print to screen the duck population each year.\n",

    "5. Write a program that finds all Pythagorean triples $(a, b, c)$, such that $a+b+c < 4342$.  Recall that three integers form a Pythagorean triple if $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.\n",
    "5. Write a function, `is_prime(n)`, that determines whether the number `n` is prime. Use this function in a program that finds the first 100 prime numbers.  Can you make this process more efficient? How long does it take to find the first 1000 prime numbers?\n"
